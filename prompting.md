# Prompting Guide: Collaborative Software Development with AI

This guide outlines a structured approach to developing software using a collaborative process between a reasoning model (e.g., Gemini) and a coding-focused AI model (referred to as "Cline").

## Core Principles

*   **Full-Context Planning is important**: The reasoning model handles high-level, architectural planning, while Cline focuses on code implementation.
*   **Phased Implementation**: Work is broken down into manageable phases to facilitate iterative development.
*   **Continuous Documentation**: `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files track the plan and progress.
*   **Refactoring for Maintainability**: Code is regularly refactored to keep it clean and manageable as the project grows.

## Workflow Steps with Prompts

### Initial Setup and Planning


1. **High-Level Design (Reasoning Model)**

    *   **Prompt 1:**  "Let's discuss a new software project. My goal is to build [describe your project and its purpose, e.g., a web app for task management, a command-line tool for data analysis, etc.]. What are your initial thoughts on the tech stack, application architecture, and any scalability considerations we should keep in mind?"
    *   **Prompt 2 (follow-up, as needed):** "Based on our conversation, can you elaborate on the proposed architecture? I want to make sure I fully understand the structure before we move to the implementation plan."
2. **Implementation Framework (Reasoning Model)**

    *   **Prompt 3:** "Now that we have a high-level design, please create a detailed `IMPLEMENTATION.md` plan. This plan should be suitable for a developer to execute (like a coding-focused AI). It should outline the initial project setup: environment setup, the models (like frontend framework, backend language, etc.) and databases we'll use, and the basic routing or stub functions, but not full functionality yet unless it's a very small project. Critically, organize this plan into discrete development phases."
3. **Project Initialization**

    *   **Action:** In VS Code, navigate to your project directory.
    *   **Action:** Create a file named `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
    *   **Action:** Paste the content generated by the Reasoning Model (from Prompt 3) into `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
    *   **Action:** Start a new chat session in Cline.

### Phase 1 Implementation

4. **Phase 1 Execution (Cline)**

    *   **Prompt 4:** "Carefully review the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` plan and proceed with Phase 1 implementation step by step. Update the memory bank each step."
5. **Progress Tracking (Cline)**

    *   **Prompt 5 (after Phase 1 is complete):** "Phase 1 implementation is complete. Now, create a `PROGRESS.md` file. Summarize the progress made in Phase 1 and outline the next steps according to the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` plan."
6. **Testing and Debugging**

    *   **Action:** Thoroughly test the functionality implemented in Phase 1.
    *   **Prompt 6 (if you encounter bugs):** "I've encountered the following issue during testing: [describe the error or unexpected behavior]. Can you help me debug and fix this?"

### Subsequent Phases

7. **Phase Transition (Cline)**

    *   **Action:** Create a new chat in Cline.
    *   **Prompt 7:** "Review `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `PROGRESS.md`.  proceed with next step.
8. implementation is complete. Now, update `PROGRESS.md` file. Summarize the progress made and outline the next steps according to the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` plan."
9. **Iterative Development**

    *   **Action:** Repeat prompts 4-7 (implementation, progress tracking, testing) for each subsequent phase in `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

### Feature/Component Implementation

9. **Feature Planning (Reasoning Model)**

    *   **(Optional) Action:** If your codebase is reasonably small, consolidate it into a single file for easier context sharing.
    *   **Action:** Return to the Reasoning Model.
    *   **Prompt 8:**  "I now want to add a new feature/component: [describe the feature/component and its purpose]. Examine the provided codebase (paste here or describe its structure) and generate a phased implementation plan for \[feature/component name]. Include code examples where appropriate. Break the plan into discrete phases for a developer to follow, similar to the initial `IMPLEMENTATION.md`."
10. **Implementation Plan Update**

    *   **Action:** Replace the content of `IMPLEMENTATION.md` with the new feature-specific plan generated by the Reasoning Model.
    *   **Action:** Clear the contents of `PROGRESS.md`.
11. **Feature Implementation (Cline)**

    *   **Prompt 9:** "Review the updated `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Proceed with the first phase of the \[feature/component name] implementation step by step. Update the memory bank each step."
12. **Iterative Feature Development**

    *   **Action:** Repeat prompts 4-7 (implementation, progress tracking, testing) for each phase of the feature implementation.

### Refactoring

13. **Refactoring Planning (Reasoning Model)**

    *   **Action:** When a file exceeds ~300 lines, provide the code to the Reasoning Model.
    *   **Prompt 10:** "This code file is getting large (over 300 lines). Please generate a phased plan to refactor this code into smaller, more manageable files, while preserving its functionality. The goal is to improve maintainability and readability. Explain your reasoning behind the proposed refactoring."
    *   **Action**: copy the output to `IMPLEMENTATION.md`
14. **Refactoring Implementation (Cline)**
    * **Prompt 11:** "Please implement the phased refactoring plan outlined in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` step by step. Update the memory bank each step."

### Scaling and Context Limits

*   This approach is designed to scale up to projects with approximately 2 million tokens (the context limit for `gemini-exp-1206`).
*   For larger projects, consider breaking the project down into smaller, more self-contained modules, and repeat the process in this guide.

### Communication and Troubleshooting

*   Feel free to ask questions or seek clarification at any point during the process. This guide is meant to be a starting point, and adjustments can be made based on your specific needs.

## Important Notes

*   **Memory Bank**: Reminding Cline to update its memory bank is important for maintaining context, especially as projects grow.
*   **Full-Context Planning**: Always return to the Reasoning Model for planning that requires broader context than Cline can handle.
